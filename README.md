# 2009-videoediting
for trimming all of the milestone videos

You'll need to install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), which is probably best done using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

I used Google Sheets to organize things to run this script (check the 2.009 2017 google drive for examples, especially the 3 Ideas Timestamps file).

Usage (also in the script):

`sh fadetrim.sh <inputVideo> <outputVideo> <inputTimestampSeconds> <outputTimestampSeconds>`
